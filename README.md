# Power BI Advanced Dashboard with ChatGPT & Custom Visuals 🎯

An end‑to‑end Power BI project showcasing integration of ChatGPT (via Python), HTML‑based visuals using DENEB, and advanced data insights from live streaming sources.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an interactive Power BI report that:

* Extracts and enriches raw data using Python and ChatGPT prompts.
* Implements custom-designed visuals in HTML/CSS using the **DENEB** custom visual framework.
* Provides real-time or regularly updated analytics for decision-makers.

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

* **Power BI Desktop** – Report building, data modeling, and dashboard layouts.
* **Python** – Data enrichment with the ChatGPT API or OpenAI Python SDK.
* **ChatGPT** – Generating insights, text summaries, or metadata enhancement.
* **DENEB Custom Visual** – HTML/CSS visuals embedded in Power BI.
* **Data connectors/APIs** – (e.g. Spotify live dataset; adapt as needed).
* **DAX & Power Query (M)** – For modeling and calculated metrics.

---

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushr57/Spotify-Listener--Dashboard-.git
   ```
2. Ensure **Power BI Desktop** (latest version) is installed.
3. In the `Python` folder, install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop and link to Python scripts as sources.

---

## 🚀 Usage

* Load datasets (e.g. live streaming stats, logs, CSV exports).
* Run the Python enrichment script to annotate data via ChatGPT.
* In Power BI:

  * Visualize data using built-in and custom HTML visuals.
  * Use DAX to calculate KPIs (e.g. sentiment scores, top insights).
  * Deploy slicers, filters, and drill-through pages for interactivity.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

* 🧠 **ChatGPT-powered enrichment**: Produce labels, summaries, or sentiment analysis in combination with your data.
* 🎨 **DENEB-custom visuals**: Embed flexible, HTML-based charts beyond standard Power BI visuals.
* 📊 **Dynamic dashboards**: Real-time insights if hooked to live APIs or streaming services.
* 📈 **Advanced modeling**: Custom DAX measures, trend visuals, drill-down capabilities.

## 🔄 Customizing for Your Data

Want to adapt this project? Consider using:

* Alternative datasets (Spotify, Google Analytics, customer logs, etc.).
* Other LLM providers (replace ChatGPT API with your preference).
* Custom visual libraries (extend DENEB templates with more interactivity).

---

## ✅ Benefits & Use Cases

* Portfolio showcase for advanced Power BI, Python, LLM, and custom visual expertise.
* Useful template for dashboards combining AI-generated text insights with visual analytics.
* Adaptable to business reporting, research dashboards, or streaming analytics.
