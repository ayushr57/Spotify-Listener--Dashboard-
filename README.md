# Spotify Listners Insights Dashboard 🎯

An end‑to‑end Power BI project showcasing integration of ChatGPT (via Python) and advanced data insights from live streaming sources.

-----

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an interactive Power BI report that:

  * Extracts and enriches raw data using Python and ChatGPT prompts.
  * Provides real-time or regularly updated analytics for decision-makers.

-----

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

  * **Power BI Desktop** – Report building, data modeling, and dashboard layouts.
  * **Python** – Data enrichment with the ChatGPT API or OpenAI Python SDK.
  * **ChatGPT** – Generating insights, text summaries, or metadata enhancement.
  * **Data connectors/APIs** – (e.g. Spotify live dataset; adapt as needed).
  * **DAX & Power Query (M)** – For modeling and calculated metrics.

-----

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayushr57/Spotify-Listener--Dashboard-.git
    ```

2.  Ensure **Power BI Desktop** (latest version) is installed.

3.  In the `Python` folder, install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop and link to Python scripts as sources.

-----

## 🚀 Usage

  * Load datasets (e.g. live streaming stats, logs, CSV exports).

  * Run the Python enrichment script to annotate data via ChatGPT.

  * In Power BI:

      * Visualize data using built-in Power BI visuals.
      * Use DAX to calculate KPIs (e.g. sentiment scores, top insights).
      * Deploy slicers, filters, and drill-through pages for interactivity.

-----

## 🎯 Key Features

  * 🧠 **ChatGPT-powered enrichment**: Produce labels, summaries, or sentiment analysis in combination with your data.
  * 📊 **Dynamic dashboards**: Real-time insights if hooked to live APIs or streaming services.
  * 📈 **Advanced modeling**: Custom DAX measures, trend visuals, drill-down capabilities.

## 🔄 Customizing for Your Data

Want to adapt this project? Consider using:

  * Alternative datasets (Spotify, Google Analytics, customer logs, etc.).
  * Other LLM providers (replace ChatGPT API with your preference).

-----

## ✅ Benefits & Use Cases

  * Portfolio showcase for advanced Power BI, Python, and LLM expertise.
  * Useful template for dashboards combining AI-generated text insights with visual analytics.
  * Adaptable to business reporting, research dashboards, or streaming analytics.
